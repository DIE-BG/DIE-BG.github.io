title: "Research Projects"
---

This section compiles ongoing and completed research projects conducted by DIE-BG that go beyond the scope of our core tools.

Projects hosted here typically involve applied macroeconomic research, forecasting exercises, structural analysis, or experimental modeling initiatives.

## Purpose

The *Projects* section serves as a flexible space to:

- Document exploratory or complementary studies.
- Share empirical investigations not tied to HEFM or HEMI.
- Publish internal working drafts, validation reports, or topic-specific models.
- Host specialized forecasting tools such as Nowcasting modules.

## Active Projects

- [Nowcasting](./nowcasting/index.qmd): A real-time indicator system integrating news and statistical signals.

## How to Navigate

Each project has its own subfolder and includes:
- A short description and purpose
- Methodological notes and documents
- Results, simulations, and visualizations
- Supplementary files, when applicable
